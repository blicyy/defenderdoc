# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Defender in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **adding it to your server**.

Or **try Defender immediately** with **[new.defenderbot.tk](https://new.defenderbot.tk)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Defender config using the **classic template**:

```shell
?setup classic
```

## Configure the settings

View/set the configurations:

```shell
?config
```

Your server is now protected!

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
